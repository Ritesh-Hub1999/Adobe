Example: 

Input: ar1[] = {10};
       ar2[] = {2, 3};
Output: ar1[] = {2}
        ar2[] = {3, 10}  

Input: ar1[] = {1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20};
       ar2[] = {2, 3, 8, 13};
Output: ar1[] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}
        ar2[] = {10, 13, 15, 20}

Algorithm

1) Initialize i,j,k as 0,0,n-1 where n is size of arr1 
2) Iterate through every element of arr1 and arr2 using two pointers i and j respectively
    if arr1[i] is less than arr2[j]
        increment i
    else
        swap the arr2[j] and arr1[k]
        increment j and decrement k

3) Sort both arr1 and arr2 
Below is the implementation of the above algorithm


// CPP program for the above approach
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
// Function to merge two arrays
void merge(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
{
    int i = 0, j = 0, k = n - 1;
   
    // Until i less than equal to k
    // or j is less than m
    while (i <= k && j < m) {
        if (arr1[i] < arr2[j])
            i++;
        else {
            swap(arr2[j++], arr1[k--]);
        }
    }
   
    // Sort first array
    sort(arr1, arr1 + n);
   
    // Sort second array
    sort(arr2, arr2 + m);
}
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
 
    int ar1[] = { 1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20 };
    int ar2[] = { 2, 3, 8, 13 };
    int m = sizeof(ar1) / sizeof(ar1[0]);
    int n = sizeof(ar2) / sizeof(ar2[0]);
    merge(ar1, ar2, m, n);
 
    cout << "After Merging \nFirst Array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        cout << ar1[i] << " ";
    cout << "\nSecond Array: ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        cout << ar2[i] << " ";
    return 0;
}
Output
After Merging 
First Array: 1 2 3 5 8 9 
Second Array: 10 13 15 20 
Complexities:
Time Complexity: The time complexity while traversing the arrays in while loop is O(n+m) in worst case and sorting is O(nlog(n) + mlog(m)). So overall time complexity of the code becomes O((n+m)log(n+m)).
Space Complexity: As the function doesnâ€™t use any extra array for any operations, the space complexity is O(1).
