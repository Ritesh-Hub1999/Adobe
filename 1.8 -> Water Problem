There are N water tanks in a row. you are given an array A of size N where Ai

Example:
-------
Input:
N = 4,
A = {7, 18, 16, 14}
Output: 15
Explanation: 
At the beginning of the operation tank has {7,18,16,14}
Shift water from 1st tank, remaining water {0,17,15,13}
Shift water from 3rd tank, remaining water {0,16, 0,12}
Shift water from 4th tank, remaining water {0,15, 0, 0}
Shift water from 2nd tank, remaining water {0, 0, 0, 0}
Therefore the capacity of bucket needs to be of 15 units.

Example:
-------
Input:
N = 1,
A = {3}
Output: 3
Explanation: We will shift the water from the only
tank available.

Explanation:
------------
{7, 18, 16, 14}

sort: {7, 14, 16, 18}

7 {0, 13, 15, 17}
13{0, 0, 14, 16}
14{0, 0, 0, 15}
15{0,0,0,0}

Approch:
-------
step 1: Sort the Array 

Step 2: count minute in every interval

step 3: find the max bucket capacity 
        by subtracting the minute in 
        every interval
Code:
-----
int minCapacity(int n,int a[])
	{
		sort(a,a+n);
		int minute = 0;
		int maxCap = INT_MIN;
		
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
		    maxCap = max(maxCap,a[i] - minute);
		    minute++;
		}
		
		return maxCap;
	}
